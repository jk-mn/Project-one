This project is a Sales Dashboard analyzing a dataset with 37.87K total quantity sold, generating $2.30M in revenue and $286.40K in profit, with a 12.47% profit margin. The dashboard breaks down revenue by category (Technology: $719.05K, Furniture: $836.15K, Office Supplies: $742.02K) and profit by region (East: $501.23K, West: $725.45K). Key insights include Technology driving 60% of profit growth over the past 4 years and a high-margin region (West) contributing significantly. SQL scripts were used for data preparation, and the dashboard is built in Power BI.
